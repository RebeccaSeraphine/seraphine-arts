Working in close cooperation with the LO-ANH Foundation (LOAN Stiftung) I created the illustration &amp;ldquo;DAWN&amp;rdquo; inspired by the coming Lunar New Year of the Tiger. 100% of the profit from this artwork, including all related products, will be donated to the foundation to support disadvantaged children from ethnic minorities in the most remote areas of Vietnam.
The work of the LO-ANH Foundation (LOAN Stiftung) includes the construction of kindergardens, elementary schools, boarding houses and scholarships for education as well as sponsorships for orphans in Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s poorest regions, where almost no other NGOs are active because of the difficult geographical access.</description></item></channel></rss>
