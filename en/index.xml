Inspired by the Vietnamese Lunar Year of the Cat, the two-part set &amp;ldquo;Reflection&amp;rdquo; continues the &amp;ldquo;art for charity&amp;rdquo; project and cooperation with the LO-ANH Foundation (LOAN Stiftung) in 2023.
Like before, all profits from this collection will be donated quarterly to the LOAN Stiftung to support children in need.
Update July 2023: Thank you for an amazing first six months!</description></item></channel></rss>
