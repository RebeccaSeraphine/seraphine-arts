Inspired by the Lunar New Year of the Tiger 2022, I created the illustration "DAWN" as the first motif of the art for charity cooperation with the [LOAN Foundation (LOAN Stiftung)](https://loan-stiftung.de/?lang=en). "DAWN" will be exclusively available throughout the Lunar Year of the Tiger, with all funds being transferred to the LOAN Foundation every quarter.

**Update February 2022:** Thanks to your amazing support we were able to raise 340€ and make our first donation. ❤️

**Update July 2022:** An additional 200€ were raised through the cooperation and donated to help children in need. Thank you so much for your support!

**Update November 2022:** We were able to raise and donate another 271€ to support the foundation and its projects. Thank you!

**Update January 2023:** The final donation in 2022 has reached the LOAN Foundation and we are incredibly happy that we have now raised over 1,000€ to support children in need (1,120€ total). We are excited to continue the cooperation with a new motif in 2023 and thank you so much for your support throughout this year! ❤️
