Making a difference with art ❤️


Working in close cooperation, the [LO-ANH Foundation (LOAN Stiftung)](https://loan-stiftung.de/?lang=en) and I started an art for charity project, where **100% of the profit from an illustration, including all related products, is donated to support disadvantaged children in the most remote areas of Vietnam.** Started in 2022 and inspired by the Animals of the Vietnamese Lunar Calendar, a new artwork is published each year. You can find an overview of all products with the current illustration [here](https://shop.seraphine-arts.com/en/collections/reflection).

The work of the LO-ANH Foundation (LOAN Stiftung) includes the construction of kindergardens, elementary schools and boarding houses as well as educational scholarships and support for orphans in Vietnam's poorest regions, where almost no other NGOs are active because of the difficult geographical access. Every contribution goes directly and fully into the foundation's projects for children in need.

Inspired by the wonders of our planet my artworks reflect the colourful beauty of our world. While I hope that my creations bring people joy and happiness, I also wish them to make a lasting difference. **With your support, we were able to raise over 1,000€ in the first year. Thank you!**

If you have any questions about the cooperation, don't hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:seraphinearts@gmail.com) or contact me on social media. :)
