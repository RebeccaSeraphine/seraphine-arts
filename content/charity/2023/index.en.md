Just as the light of the sun lets the moon shine, our world reflects the good we do.
Inspired by the Vietnamese Lunar Year of the Cat, the two-part set "Reflection" continues the "art for charity" project and cooperation with the [LO-ANH Foundation (LOAN Stiftung)](https://loan-stiftung.de/?lang=en) in 2023.

Like before, all profits from this [collection](https://shop.seraphine-arts.com/en/collections/reflection) will be donated quarterly to the LOAN Stiftung to support children in need.
