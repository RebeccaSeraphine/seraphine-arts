Inspired by the Lunar New Year of the Tiger 2022, the DAWN illustrations were created as an art for charity project in close cooperation with the LOAN Foundation (LOAN Stiftung). 100% of the profit from all reproductions of this arwork, is donated to the foundation to support disadvantaged children from ethnic minorities in the most remote areas of Vietnam.
