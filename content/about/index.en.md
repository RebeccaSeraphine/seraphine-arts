# About

Hello wanderer and welcome to this colourful place! I am Seraphine, an artist and colouring book author from Germany who creates intricate illustrations in a contemporary style. My art is inspired by the beautiful diversity of our natural world and I hope to bring humanity and nature closer together & inspires happiness and positive change.

Currently I am focusing on uplifting digital illustrations but also worked with watercolour and acrylic paint in the past. Besides my art I also enjoy outdoor activities, caring for my many houseplants and working as a frontend developer.

Wether you are looking for colourful wall art, colouring pages or just want to browse through the artworks, I hope you enjoy your stay and find something that makes you smile.
