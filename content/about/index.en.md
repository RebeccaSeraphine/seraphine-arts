# About

Hello wanderer and welcome to this colourful place! I am Seraphine, an artist and colouring book author from Germany who creates intricate illustrations in a contemporary style. My art is inspired by the beautiful diversity of our natural world and I hope to bring humanity and nature closer together & inspire happiness and positive change.

Currently I am focusing on digital illustrations but also work with watercolour and other traditional mediums. Besides my art I enjoy outdoor activities, caring for my many houseplants and working as a frontend developer. If you have any questions or simply want to stay up to date, you can find me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SeraphineArts/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seraphinearts/). Since 2021 you can also find my work in the local shops [s'Fachl Karlsruhe](https://www.fachl.at/de-at/Standorte/Deutschland/s-Fachl-Karlsruhe) and [s'Fachl Kiel](https://www.fachl.at/de-at/Standorte/Deutschland/s-Fachl-Kiel).

Wether you are looking for colourful wall art, colouring pages or just want to browse through the artworks, I hope you enjoy your stay and find something that makes you smile.
